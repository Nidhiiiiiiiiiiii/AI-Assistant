# Personal AI Assistant with Context Retention

A sophisticated conversational AI assistant that maintains context across conversations, learns user preferences, adapts communication style, and provides personalized assistance using Google Gemini.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements a multi-level memory system that builds a comprehensive user profile over time, handling various request types while maintaining conversation continuity and personalizing interactions.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Phase 1: Core Assistant Infrastructure

#### User Profile Management
- Unique user identification system
- Comprehensive profile schema including:
  - Demographics (optional)
  - Preferences (topics, communication style)
  - Interaction patterns
  - Task history
  - Knowledge domains
- Secure storage with encryption

#### Request Classification Engine
- Multi-label classification for:
  - Information queries
  - Task management
  - Calculations/analysis
  - Recommendations
  - Casual conversation
  - Learning requests
- Intent detection with confidence scores
- Entity extraction and slot filling

#### Session Management
- Conversation threading
- Context window management
- Session persistence across devices
- Conversation branching support

### Phase 2: Memory Architecture 

#### Short-term Memory (Working Memory)
- Current conversation context (last 10-15 exchanges)
- Active task states
- Temporary variables and calculations
- Recent entity mentions
- Implementation: Redis with TTL

#### Long-term Memory Systems

**Declarative Memory:**
- User facts and preferences
- Learned information
- Custom knowledge base

**Procedural Memory:**
- Task completion patterns
- User-specific workflows
- Successful solution strategies

**Episodic Memory:**
- Complete conversation histories
- Significant events/milestones
- Emotional context markers

#### Semantic Memory Network
- Knowledge graph of user interests
- Concept relationships
- Domain-specific vocabularies
- Cross-reference system

### Phase 3: Personalization Engine 

#### Communication Style Adaptation
- Analyze user's language patterns:
  - Formality level
  - Vocabulary complexity
  - Sentence structure
  - Emoji/punctuation usage
- Mirror appropriate style elements
- Gradual adaptation over time

#### Preference Learning
- Track interaction patterns:
  - Topic preferences
  - Response length preferences
  - Detail level requirements
  - Time-of-day patterns
- Build preference vectors
- A/B test response strategies

#### Proactive Assistance
- Reminder system with smart scheduling
- Habit detection and reinforcement
- Contextual suggestions
- Predictive task completion
